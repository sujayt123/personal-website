    My roommate Daniel Williams once composed a biography on my behalf as part of a college leadership exercise. I thought he captured
    my personality rather well. Keep in mind this was written before I began my formal study of computer science.

    "Philosophy major by day, electrical engineering major by night, tabla player on the weekends, Sujay Tadwalkar is a modern day renaissance man, and he can tell you all about the beliefs of that time period too. He can take a Shakespeare reference and turn it into a pun involving Spongebob with great skill, and youâ€™ll be groaning for days every time you think about it. He can regale you with tales of his Californian escapades, all filled with excitement, boba tea, and even more puns. He can peer into the depths of the philosophy of Descartes, Nietzsche, Hume, and many other great philosophers, all while making still more puns. Pretty much, Sujay just really loves puns. Whether it be Frozen, Laplace transforms, or Kendrick Lamar, Sujay can talk to almost anyone about almost anything, and with him [in your life] there will never be a dull moment."
